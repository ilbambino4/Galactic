PRACTICE GAME DEVELOPEMENT PROJECT

This is a small game dev project I am using for practice.

Currently there is no release or exe file to run. Running the project
requires...

Visual Studios 2022:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022

Lates Installation of Monogame:
https://monogame.net/articles/getting_started/index.html

Once both are installed the project can be run opening the Galactic Survival solution located in Galactic/GalacticSurvival/GalacticSurvival.sln
and, running the application from Visual Studios after the solution is open.
